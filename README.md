# proton3
### A song of quantum

A quantum synthesizer that udelizes quantum wavefunctions in order to generate
sound. Kindly supported by [Quantum Social Lab](https://quantumsociallab.de/).

## Installation

Proton3 is currently under development and not yet available on PyPI. To install
the latest version, we recommend pulling the latest version, creating a fresh
python environment and run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
pip install . -e
```

## Usage

Currently the supported potentials used to generate sound are:

- Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (One Dimensional)

In the future, we plan to support:

- Double Square Well
- Quantum Barrier
- Hydrogen Atom
